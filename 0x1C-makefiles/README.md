A Makefile is a script or configuration file used with the "make" build automation tool. It contains a set of rules that specify how to compile and build a software project. Makefiles are commonly used in C and C++ projects, but they can be used for various other programming languages and projects as well.

The primary purpose of a Makefile is to describe the dependencies between files in a project and the actions needed to create or update those files. It consists of rules that define targets (output files), dependencies (input files), and the commands or actions to build the targets based on the dependencies.

Each rule in a Makefile typically follows this structure:

makefile
Copy code
target: dependencies
    command1
    command2
    ...
target is the name of the output file or action.
dependencies are the input files or prerequisites needed to build the target.
command1, command2, etc., are the shell commands that will be executed to build the target.
When you run the make command in the directory containing the Makefile, it reads the Makefile and executes the necessary commands to update or create the specified target(s) based on the file dependencies and their modification times.

Makefiles help automate the build process by only recompiling the necessary parts of a project when changes are made, saving time and effort in the development workflow.
